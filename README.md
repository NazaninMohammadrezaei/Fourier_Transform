# Fourier Transform
In this repository, I gather the materials about fourier transform which I have learned from the udemy course `Master the Fourier transform and its applications` by `Dr. Mike X. Cohen`. I actually focused not only on the libraries that contribute to simply use fourier transform, but also on implementing it totally from the ground up without using the specific libraries in order to understand the mathematical basis of every line of code. 

Make sure to visit Dr. Cohen's website: [www.mikexcohen.com](https://www.mikexcohen.com/)

Also file names are representative of their content , but here is an explanation for each of them:
